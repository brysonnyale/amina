## Creating a Discord Bot
Set up a discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and add it to your server.

Scopes:
- bot
- application.commands

Bot Permissions:
- read messages/view channels
- send messages
- create public threads
- create private threads
- send messages in threads
- embed links
- attach files
- use slash commands

You also need to enable the Message Content Intent:

</details>

## Setup

- You can see the [Replit installation guide here](./replit.md)

- Or you can set it up on your machine.

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites:

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/): (18 or above)

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

- [pm2](https://pm2.io/docs/runtime/guide/installation/): To keep your bot alive 24/7

## ðŸš€ Setup
- Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikkshan/mochi.git
cd mochi
```
(in windows, right click somewhere in the folder and select "Open In Terminal")
if you see something about powershell, type `cmd` and hit enter, to go to the simpler command line terminal.

- Install dependancies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you need any additional help setting up the dashboard, make sure to read our guides [here](./README.md##-dashboard-setup)

## Setting up Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for mochi to work properly.

You can set the environment variables in any way you like, or place an .env file at the root of your project (rename `.env.example` to `.env`),
Ensure that your `.env` looks like this:
<details>
  <summary> [EXPAND] Click to see .env</summary>
  
```bash
# Bot Token [Required]
BOT_TOKEN=

# Mongo Database Connection String [Required]
MONGO_CONNECTION=

# Webhooks [Optional]
ERROR_LOGS=
JOIN_LEAVE_LOGS=

# Dashboard [Required for dashboard]
BOT_SECRET=
SESSION_PASSWORD=

# Required for Weather Command (https://weatherstack.com)
WEATHERSTACK_KEY=

# Required for image commands (https://strangeapi.fun/docs)
STRANGE_API_KEY=

# SPOTFIY [Required for Spotify Support]
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
</details>


MongoDB:
- MONGODB_CONNECTION: The MongoDB connection string.
  - Should look something like this: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password><cluster>.<something>.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority

Bot Token:
- BOT_TOKEN: The Discord bot token
  - You can get it from your [Discord Dev Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by selecting your app and then selecting "Bot".

Discord Server Details:
- ERROR_LOGS: (Optional) The webhook for error log messages
- JOIN_LEAVE_LOGS: (Optional) The webhook for join/leave log messages

Extras:
- WEATHERSTACK_KEY: (Optional) The API key for weatherstack.com
- STRANGE_API_KEY: (Optional) The API key for strangeapi.fun
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID: (Optional) The client ID for Spotify
- SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET: (Optional) The client secret for Spotify

## Start your bot
Set up the environment variables as described above.
- Install pm2:

With npm:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

With yarn:

```bash
yarn global add pm2
```

With debian, use the install script:

```bash
apt update && apt install sudo curl && curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unitech/pm2/master/packager/setup.deb.sh | sudo -E bash -
```
- Then to start the bot, run:

```bash
npm start
```

>You can also run `npm run start` to start the bot.

- NOTE: running `npm start` or `npm run start` will start the bot with PM2 and give it the name "mochi". You can replace "mochi" with a name of your choice in [package.json](./package.json). It will also show logs for the bot and save the pm2 processes.
>NOTE: If you get the error:
```js
[PM2][ERROR] Script already launched, add -f option to force re-execution
```
>It means that the bot is already running. You can delete it by running the following command followed by the command to start the bot, i.e. `npm run start`:
```
pm2 delete mochi
```
> Or simply restart it by running:
```
pm2 restart mochi
```

- If you are in dev environment, use `node .` or `npm run dev` to test your code:
```
node .
```
Once you are satisfied with the changes run:
```
pm2 restart mochi && pm2 logs
```
You can also restart it from the [pm2.io dashboard](https://pm2.io/) as shown bellow:

#### Auto-restarting your bot on git pull
- Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:

```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/vikkshan/mochi.git
```
- Create a new file in the hooks directory of your Git repository:
```
nano .git/hooks/post-merge
```
- Add the following code to the post-merge file:
```
#!/bin/sh
# pull the latest changes from GitHub
git pull origin master
# restart the bot using PM2
pm2 restart mochi
```
Save and close the file.

- Make the file executable:
```
chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
```
Now, every time you run `git pull`, it will automatically run the post-merge hook and pull the latest changes from your GitHub repository. The bot will also be restarted automatically using PM2.

>NOTE:<br>
If you want to use `git pull` to automatically update your code, then you will need to keep your GitHub repository public. If you want to keep your code private, you can consider using a different method such as deploying from your machine or using a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool such as Jenkins, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc. These tools allow you to securely deploy code from a private repository without exposing it publicly.

## Dashboard Setup

- In the config.js, make sure you set dashboard enabled to **true**
- Add your baseURL and `http://localhost:8080/api/callback` in your application OAuth2 redirects page in the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

```js
  DASHBOARD: {
    enabled: true, // enable or disable dashboard
    baseURL: "http://localhost:8080", // base url
    failureURL: "http://localhost:8080", // failure redirect url
    port: "8080", // port to run the bot on
  },
```
- To run your dashboard on your own domain, follow this guide [ðŸ”Œ | Connect Dashboard - DJS Bot - Ubuntu - Apache](https://blog.riverdev.wtf/connect-dashboard-djs-bot-ubuntu-apache) by [River](https://github.com/River198)

## Extra Setup

### Setting up Slash Commands

- Slash commands are disabled by default
- In the [**config.js**](./config.js) set **`SLASH = true`** and **`CONTEXT = true`** and replace `TEST_GUILD_ID` with the guild ID where you want to initially test the commands. This will ensure that all the commands are registered immediately
- Once you are happy with the commands, set **`GLOBAL = true`** to register these interactions globally

>**Global slash commands** can take upto 1 hour to be shown across all guilds. You can use the `m!reload` command to sync the commands across all guilds. This will also update the commands if you have made any changes to them.
